# Task Manager program
In this project, a task manager program was created to assign and manage tasks assigned to members within a team. 
## Basic functionality of the program is as follows: 
* There is one adminstrator and only the administrator is able to register new users. Upon registration of a new user, the administrator is prompted to enter the credentials of a new user such as a username and a password. 
The credentials are then saved to a text file called 'user.txt'.
* While the users are logged in, they are able to add tasks to the program. The user in prompted to enter thier username, the title of the task, the task description, the date assigned
as well as the due date of the task. Once completed, the task is saved to a text file called 'tasks.txt'.
* Uses are able to view their own tasks and are given the ability to edit their or mark them as complete.
* Users are able to view all tasks added to the program.
* Statistics are generated by the program keeping track of the following details:
### User:
* The total number of users registered with task manager program
* The total number of tasks assigned to that user.
* What percentage of the total number of tasks have
been assigned to that user?
* What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
have been completed?
* What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
must still be completed?
* What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
have not yet been completed and are overdue?
### Tasks:

tracked using the task manager program. 
* The total number of completed tasks.
* The total number of uncompleted tasks.
